Write a program that finds the minimum k for which there is a set of k-length probes complementary to the sequence set 
(each probe complementary to exactly one sequence in the set) given in the .fasta file. The solution is a program (with comments) 
that finds the minimum k and the result of its execution for selected genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast.fa.
