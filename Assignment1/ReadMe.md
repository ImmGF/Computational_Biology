The idea is to create and compare two phylogenetic trees created from the whole genome sequence of the coronavirus and from its spike protein.

Write a script that creates these two plots using the following steps:
- Downloading the sequences from Entrez using Bio.Entrez
- Creating multiple alignments of both DNA (whole genome) and protein (spike protein) sequences
- Creating phylogenetic trees for both protein and genome alignments using the UPGMA and neighbor joining algorithms
- Visualizing the trees
